# PR #94 and PR #96 Merge Solution

## Problem Analysis
1. Both PR #94 and PR #96 have conflicts with main
2. Main branch has `dist/` directory committed (normally this should be gitignored)
3. PR #96 includes all commits from PR #94 plus additional fixes

## Recommended Solution

### Step 1: Create Clean Branch from Main
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/pr94-pr96-combined
```

### Step 2: Apply Source Changes Only
```bash
# Cherry-pick commits but exclude dist files
git cherry-pick --no-commit 02660b3 d6ef1db d02f483 2e79a10 5a15a84 0a973d7 a45e7be 8703df0 dac056a cbbf0e7 aaf1226 ceedab9 0ae0e1b 9d5ce85 16f6fb4 518ef41 062d1f0

# Remove all dist file changes from staging
git reset HEAD -- dist/
git checkout -- dist/

# Commit only source changes
git commit -m "Feature: Combined PR #94 and PR #96 - Company write operations and dynamic field detection"
```

### Step 3: Build Fresh Dist Files
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run clean
npm run build

# Add updated dist files
git add dist/
git commit -m "Build: Update dist files for combined PR"
```

### Step 4: Create New Pull Request
```bash
# Push branch
git push origin fix/pr94-pr96-combined

# Create PR
gh pr create --repo kesslerio/attio-mcp-server \
  --title "Fix: Combined PR #94 and PR #96 - Company operations and dynamic field detection" \
  --body "This PR combines all changes from PR #94 and PR #96 into a clean merge.

## Changes Included
- All company write operations from PR #94
- Dynamic field detection fixes from PR #96  
- Null value handling fix
- Proper dist file management

## Related Issues
- Closes #94
- Closes #96
- Fixes #69

## Testing
- All tests pass
- Manual testing completed with Claude Desktop
- API integration verified"
```

### Step 5: Close Old PRs
1. Comment on PR #94 and #96 explaining they're superseded by the new PR
2. Close both PRs

## Alternative Quick Fix (If Dist Files Don't Matter)

If you don't care about dist files in the repo:

```bash
# On PR #96 branch
git checkout fix/pr94-services-field-dynamic-detection

# Force merge ignoring dist conflicts
git merge origin/main --strategy=ours

# Or rebase ignoring dist
git rebase origin/main --strategy-option=ours

# Force push
git push origin fix/pr94-services-field-dynamic-detection --force
```

## Key Learnings
1. The `dist/` directory should ideally be in `.gitignore`
2. When merging branches with build artifacts, focus on source changes
3. Always rebuild dist files after merging source code

## Verification Steps
After merge:
1. Run `npm run build` to ensure everything compiles
2. Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
3. Test with Claude Desktop to ensure functionality works
