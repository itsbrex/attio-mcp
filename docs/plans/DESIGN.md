# Design — Interactive Plan Pages (v2)

System doc for the self-contained HTML plan/decision pages under `docs/plans/`.
A plan page is a single offline `.html` file the reader **acts on**: every
decision item can be approved, rejected, or edited in place, then submitted
back to Claude for execution.

Reader context: a developer on a laptop reviewing proposals — approving some,
rewording others — in a dim room at night or a bright cafe by day. The page must
stay legible in glare, dense without sprawling, and every action must feel
instant.

## Creating a page (required workflow)

Never hand-roll a plan page from scratch. Stamp one:

```bash
bun run plans new <slug> --title "Human Title" --source "claude session <id> / <what prompted it>"
```

This assigns the next sequence number from `plans.config.json`, injects the
repo's persistent accent color, stamps date/repo/provenance into the meta strip,
writes `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<slug>.html`, and regenerates the dashboard. Then edit
the file: fill the thesis paragraph (`#plan-sub`), replace the sample
`PLAN_ITEMS`, and optionally add `.prose` context sections above the groups.

## Numbering & provenance

- `plans.config.json` holds `nextSeq`; every stamped page gets a monotonically
  increasing `#NNN` badge, embedded as `data-plan-seq` on `<html>` and in the
  filename. Highest seq = latest plan, always.
- The meta strip on every page shows `#NNN · date · repo · source`. `--source`
  should say where the content came from (session, prompt, review, etc.).
- The dashboard (`index.html`, auto-regenerated) lists pages newest-first with
  seq badges and marks the latest.

## Interactivity contract

Each page defines `PLAN_ITEMS`, an array of decision items:

```js
{ id: "d01",            // unique + stable within the page
  group: "Migration",   // section heading it renders under
  kind: "edit",         // "edit" | "structural" | "verify" | "note"
  title: "One-line statement of the decision",
  why: "Rationale / consequence the reader needs to judge it",
  current: "Status quo (omit or \"\" when N/A)",
  suggested: "Proposed change — editable by the reader",
  dflt: "approved" }    // OPTIONAL pre-selected state: "approved"|"rejected";
                        // seeded once — a saved reader decision always wins
```

Reader affordances (v11, already wired in the template — do not remove):

- **Two views.** Overview (thesis, prose context, stat tiles, grouped one-line
  rows) and a typeform-style **focus mode** — one decision at a time, centered
  card, direction-aware slide between cards. `Enter` on the overview starts at
  the first pending item; `O`/`Esc` toggles back.
- **Keyboard-first.** `↓/J` next · `↑/K` prev · `A` approve · `R`/`X` reject ·
  `E` edit (⌘↵ save, Esc cancel) · `U` revert edit · `P`/`⇧P` next/prev
  pending · `Home`/`End` · `S`/`⌘↵` submit · `?` help overlay. Approve/reject
  **auto-advance** (~260 ms after visual feedback); pressing the same key again
  clears back to pending and never advances. Editing never auto-advances.
- **Submit validation + review mode.** Submit with undecided items opens a
  confirm dialog listing them; "Review them" enters review mode, where
  navigation cycles ONLY the pending items (progress track dims the decided
  ones) until they're resolved — or "Submit anyway" sends them as `pending`
  (Claude skips those). With zero pending, a normal confirm dialog submits.
- **Color coding.** Per-repo accent = approve/identity; danger = reject;
  warn = edited/pending-attention. Each group gets a stable hue from the
  curated pool (skipping hues within Δ28° of the accent) shown on group chips,
  card left borders, and row stripes. Kind chips: edit=accent,
  structural=azure, verify=mint, note=amber.
- **Progress.** Segmented track under the toolbar (one clickable segment per
  item, colored by state, gaps between groups, focus ring on the current one),
  `n / N` position on every card, live ✓/✗/○ counts in the toolbar (○ jumps
  into review mode).
- **Persistence.** Decisions in `localStorage` (`plans:<slug>:<seq>`), reading
  position + view in `plans:<slug>:<seq>:ui` — reopening resumes where you
  left off. `dflt` seeding runs once and never overwrites a saved decision.
- **Accessibility.** `aria-live` announcer for card changes and submit
  results, real buttons with `aria-pressed`/labels everywhere, dialogs with
  `role=dialog aria-modal`, skip link, visible focus rings, and a persisted
  Motion: Reduced toggle (`html[data-motion=reduced]`) that kills all
  animation.
- **Theme + Motion toolbar buttons** (v13) — cycle the 13-entry theme list /
  toggle motion; both persist under the shared `plan-ui` localStorage key.
- **Submit to Claude** POSTs the full decision payload to
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/submit`, where `<port>` is the repo's own listener
  port stamped from `plans.config.json` (`port`, 47614–47899, derived
  deterministically from `appName` — 47613 was the pre-v14 shared port and is
  no longer used). When the listener is offline — or is serving a _different_
  plan (see the slug handshake below) — the page downloads
  `<slug>-decisions.json` instead. A status dot pings `/ping` every 5s and
  shows online / offline / "busy with '<other-slug>'".

### Receiving decisions (Claude side)

When you expect the user to submit, start a listener in the background and let
its exit notify you. Two collision defenses are part of the contract (both
sides shipped in v14 after a real cross-session incident):

1. **Per-repo port.** Read `port` from `docs/plans/plans.config.json` — never
   hardcode 47613 (the pre-v14 shared port). Different repos get different
   ports, so concurrent sessions don't race for one socket.
2. **Slug handshake.** Echo the plan slug you serve in `/ping` (`{ok, plan}`)
   and reject `/submit` payloads for any other slug with `{ok:false}` — save
   them aside and KEEP LISTENING. The page shows "busy" and downloads its
   JSON locally instead of feeding the wrong session.

If the port is already in use, another session in **this repo** owns it: ping
it to see which plan it serves. Never kill it blindly — a listener that
answers `/ping` is live, not stale; ask the user which plan they're reviewing.

```ts
// bun run listener.ts   (adapt OUT path + SLUG per session)
const SLUG = "<this plan's slug>";
const OUT = '<scratchpad>/plan-decisions.json';
const { port } = JSON.parse(
  await Bun.file('docs/plans/plans.config.json').text()
);
const CORS = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
};
Bun.serve({
  port,
  hostname: '127.0.0.1',
  async fetch(req) {
    if (req.method === 'OPTIONS')
      return new Response(null, { status: 204, headers: CORS });
    const u = new URL(req.url);
    if (req.method === 'GET' && u.pathname === '/ping')
      return Response.json({ ok: true, plan: SLUG }, { headers: CORS });
    if (req.method === 'POST' && u.pathname === '/submit') {
      const body = await req.text();
      let slug = 'unknown';
      try {
        slug = JSON.parse(body)?.plan?.slug ?? 'unknown';
      } catch {}
      if (slug !== SLUG) {
        // another plan's payload — save aside, stay alive
        await Bun.write(`${OUT}.foreign-${slug}.json`, body);
        return Response.json(
          { ok: false, reason: 'wrong-plan', plan: SLUG },
          { headers: CORS }
        );
      }
      await Bun.write(OUT, body);
      setTimeout(() => process.exit(0), 400);
      return Response.json({ ok: true }, { headers: CORS });
    }
    return new Response('plans listener', { headers: CORS });
  },
});
```

Payload shape: `{version, kind:"plan-decisions", plan:{seq,slug,…}, submittedAt,
decisions:[{id,group,kind,title,status,current,suggested,edited}]}`. Execute
`approved` items (honoring reader edits in `suggested`), skip `rejected` and
`pending`, treat `note` kinds as acknowledgments.

## Theme

OLED-native dark base with a full switchable theme system (v13; the old
single-theme contract is superseded). True black `#000` base, near-black
elevated surfaces separated by lightness + hairline borders, never drop
shadow. No gradient backgrounds, no gradient text, no glassmorphism.
Precision-instrument feel: dense, legible, fast.

**Default is Auto (system-aware):** dark systems resolve to **Goldenrod** (the
Cresa house theme), light systems to **Paper**, via `prefers-color-scheme`,
with a live change listener while Auto is selected. An explicit theme choice
overrides the OS and persists. The plan template cycles 13 entries on the
toolbar Theme button (Auto · Goldenrod · **Repo accent** · Mono · Graphite ·
Phosphor · Amber · Ember · Cobalt · Violet · Jade · Rose · Paper), persisted
under the shared `plan-ui` localStorage key so every plan page in a repo
follows the same choice. **Repo accent** removes `data-theme` and restores the
stamped per-repo accent on the base OLED palette. App shells (appkit ≥1.1.0
and the monolith app template) expose 12 themes in the command bar with live
preview and on `t`; Paper darkens danger/warn/focus (and the plan template's
kind-chip hues) for AA on light.

**Motion policy (deliberate):** the OS `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is
NOT honored by default — motion is full unless the person picks Motion:
Reduced (toolbar button on plan pages, command-bar Setting in app shells),
applied as `html[data-motion=reduced]` and persisted. This is a conscious
departure from the usual accessibility default for these internal tools; the
reduced setting remains one click away and sticky.

## Color

OKLCH. **The primary accent is per-repo**, randomized once by the SessionStart
hook into `docs/plans/plans.config.json` and injected into every stamped page —
all of a repo's plans share one identity color. Never hardcode a different
accent; read the config. Supporting roles are fixed:

```css
/* Base */
--bg: oklch(0 0 0);
--surface-1: oklch(0.169 0.004 265); /* card / panel */
--surface-2: oklch(0.214 0.005 265); /* sticky bar, open cards */
--surface-3: oklch(0.255 0.006 265); /* buttons, inputs */
--hairline: oklch(0.3 0.006 265);
--hairline-strong: oklch(0.4 0.008 265);

/* Ink */
--ink: oklch(0.971 0 0);
--ink-muted: oklch(0.74 0.012 265); /* >=4.5:1 on black */
--ink-faint: oklch(0.62 0.012 265); /* labels/meta at >=13px */

/* Roles */
--accent: <from plans.config.json>; /* approvals, badges, latest, identity */
--accent-ink: oklch(0.17 0.03 <hue>); /* text on accent fills */
--danger: oklch(0.7 0.2 25); /* reject, current-state stripe */
--warn: oklch(0.83 0.16 75); /* edited badge */
--focus: oklch(0.86 0.16 215); /* focus ring, visible on any accent */
```

The curated accent pool (all ≥7:1 on black): lime 132, cyan 215, violet 300,
amber 75, pink 8, coral 30, mint 165, azure 245, magenta 330, chartreuse 105,
goldenrod 84 (Cresa brand — use when a page carries the Cresa name).

### Semantic layer

Never reference `--accent` or `--danger` directly for meaning. Derive a named
role once, then use the role, so a change of accent (or theme) recolors the
whole page:

```css
--tier-crit: var(--accent); /* highest-priority items */
--tier-note: var(--ink-muted);
--tier-ctx: var(--hairline-strong);
--caution-wash: color-mix(in oklch, var(--danger), transparent 93%);
--caution-line: color-mix(in oklab, var(--danger) 36%, var(--hairline));
--verify-wash: color-mix(in oklch, var(--warn), transparent 92%);
--verify-line: color-mix(in oklab, var(--warn) 30%, var(--hairline));
```

Interpolation space is not interchangeable here. Mixing two colors that carry
different hues must use `oklab`: `oklch` interpolates hue along the shorter arc,
so blending danger (hue 25) with a hue-265 neutral swings the result through
purple at roughly hue 308. Mixing a single color with `transparent` keeps its
hue either way, so the wash tokens can stay in `oklch`. Verify the result, do
not assume it.

Applied in `.plan-template.html` (and the mono variant): caution tokens on the
rejected state chip, verify tokens on the edited state chip. Applied in the
app templates and appkit `10-tokens.css`: caution tokens on the blocked stage
pill, `--tier-crit`/`--tier-ctx` on the other stage pills.

Completion semantics are green, not accent:
`input[type=checkbox]{accent-color:var(--ok)}`.

## Typography

System stacks only, so pages open offline with zero network requests:

```css
--font-ui: system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
--font-mono: ui-monospace, 'SF Mono', 'Cascadia Code', Menlo, monospace;
```

Fixed rem scale `.75 / .8125 / .9375 / 1 / 1.125 / 1.75`. Display 700, body 400,
labels 500–600, heading letter-spacing -0.02em. Prose measure ≤76ch. Mono for:
seq badges, dates, filenames, labels, counts, code. Code blocks never wrap;
`overflow-x:auto`.

## Spacing, radius, layout

8px rhythm (`4 8 12 16 24 32 48 64`). Radius 8/12/16, pill 999 for chips/badges.
Touch-target floor 44px (38px buttons acceptable inside dense desktop toolbars).
Content `max-width:1100px` (dashboard 900px, focus-mode plan pages 960px).
Sticky toolbar solid `--surface-2` + hairline, no blur. Mobile <640px: single
column, cards stack full width.

### Widescreen (≥1680px) — app shells

Mobile-first is the default; wide viewports are an opt-in second column, never
a stretched measure. Tokens: `--measure:920px`, `--col-max:1080px`,
`--col-gap:clamp(32px,3vw,72px)`, `--wide:1680px`.

- Long prose or a single register keeps `max-width:var(--measure)` at every width.
- Two sibling sections read independently: wrap each in `.col` (which is
  `display:contents` below `--wide`, so nothing changes on mobile) inside a
  `.cols` grid of `repeat(2,minmax(0,var(--col-max)))`.
- One long list that should fill the width: CSS `columns:2` with
  `break-inside:avoid` on items (`.colflow`), so order stays top-down —
  never a left-right zigzag.
- Verify at 390 / 834 / 1440 / 2560px; no horizontal page scroll at any width.

Plan pages need no widescreen change — `.wrap` is already capped.

## Components

- **Toolbar** (sticky): seq pill + title, listener status dot, live ✓/✗/○
  count buttons (○ enters review mode), Overview toggle, primary Submit.
- **Progress track** (sticky, under toolbar): one segment per item, colored by
  state (accent/danger/neutral), group gaps, click-to-jump, focus ring on the
  current item; review mode dims decided segments.
- **Focus card**: group chip (group hue) + kind chip (kind hue) + state badge +
  `id · n / N` position; title → why → current (danger-striped) → suggested
  (accent-striped, editable) → approve/reject/edit/revert + prev/next. Card
  border and tint follow the decision state; keycap hints (`<kbd>`) on actions.
- **Overview rows**: grouped one-line buttons (state dot + id + title + badge)
  with group-hue left stripe; All / Pending-only filter chips; Enter/click
  opens focus mode at that item.
- **Review banner** (sticky, warn-tinted): undecided count + exit; shown only
  in review mode.
- **Dialogs**: shortcut help (`?`) and submit confirm (stats, undecided list,
  Review-them / Submit-anyway / Cancel) — `role=dialog aria-modal`,
  Esc closes, Enter fires the primary.
- **Shortcut footer** (fixed, desktop only): the whole key map at a glance.
- **Meta strip**: seq pill + date + repo + source — provenance at a glance.
- **Stat tiles**: decisions/approved/rejected/pending, mono numerals, colored.
- **Prose sections**: optional free-form context blocks in the overview.
- **Toast** + **aria-live announcer**: visible + screen-reader feedback for
  every action.
- States everywhere: default, hover, focus-visible, active, edited, empty.

## Motion

150–260ms ease-out: card slide (direction-aware `translateY` + fade on
navigate), state-badge pop on decide, hover lift, chip select, toast slide,
progress-segment scale on hover. Auto-advance waits ~260ms so the state
change is seen before the next card slides in. No page-load choreography.
Reduced motion is the explicit `html[data-motion=reduced]` gate (see Motion
policy under Theme) — it kills transitions, animations, and smooth scroll.

## Semantic z-index scale

Templates declare their stacking order as tokens rather than arbitrary
numbers. `.plan-template.html`: `--z-keys:80`, `--z-banner:85`, `--z-track:90`,
`--z-bar:100`, `--z-overlay:200`, `--z-skip:300`, `--z-toast:1000`. App
shells: `--z-header:30` (changes variant), `--z-drawer:40`, `--z-cmdbar:50`,
`--z-modal:55`, `--z-toast:60`. The skip link sits above the sticky toolbar
because the toolbar would otherwise cover it on focus.

## Horizontal-scroll affordance

Any container that scrolls horizontally while hiding its scrollbar needs an
edge signal. Use a mask driven by a numeric `--fade-r` custom property:

```css
--fade-r: 0;
mask-image: linear-gradient(
  to right,
  #000 calc(100% - var(--fade-r) * 44px),
  transparent 100%
);
```

Set `--fade-r` to 1 from script only while `scrollLeft < scrollWidth -
clientWidth`. At 0 the mask is a no-op, so containers that fit pay nothing.
Fade the right edge only: pinned first columns / leading elements mean a
left-edge fade would dim anchored content. Applied on the mono variant's chip
strip and the changes variant's view tabs; the v13 focus-mode plan template
has no hidden-scrollbar strip, so it carries none.

## Kanban card moves (monolith app template)

The app template's Board is a kanban: drag a card between stage columns
(HTML5 drag, pointer), or focus a card and press `[` / `]` to move it to the
previous / next visible column; the drawer carries a "Move to stage" chip row
for touch and screen readers. A move writes `r.stage`, persists to
`st.stages` keyed by `DATA` index (re-applied at boot), re-renders, restores
focus, and toasts the destination. Drop targets highlight via `.kcol.dropover`
using the accent border only. appkit's board is a grouped table, not cards —
card moves are a monolith-template feature until appkit grows a card board.

## Self-contained rule

Every plan page is one `.html` with all CSS + JS inline and system-font stacks.
It must open from `file://` with no network and no build step — `bun run plans`
(or a double-click) always works offline. The only network call is the optional
`127.0.0.1:<per-repo port>` listener ping/submit, which degrades gracefully
(offline or busy-with-another-plan both fall back to a JSON download).
