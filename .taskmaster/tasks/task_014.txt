# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create production-ready Docker containers with security hardening and optimization
# Details:
Create multi-stage Dockerfile using Node.js Alpine base image for minimal attack surface. Implement non-root user execution, secret management, and environment variable handling. Configure health checks, resource limits, and graceful shutdown handling. Create docker-compose configuration for development and production environments including Redis, monitoring stack, and load balancer.

# Test Strategy:
Container security scanning with tools like Trivy. Test container startup, health checks, and graceful shutdown. Validate resource usage and performance in containerized environment.
