# PR Merge Strategy

## Current Situation

- **PR #94** (feature/add-company-write-operations): Original PR to add company write operations
- **PR #96** (fix/pr94-services-field-dynamic-detection): Includes all of PR #94 PLUS fixes for services field and null value handling

Both PRs show as conflicting with main branch.

## Analysis

1. PR #96 already contains all commits from PR #94
2. PR #96 adds additional fixes on top of PR #94
3. Both PRs have diverged significantly from main branch
4. There are conflicts due to many files being deleted/modified differently

## Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Close PR #94 and Update PR #96 (Recommended)
1. Close PR #94 as superseded by PR #96
2. Rebase PR #96 on latest main to resolve conflicts
3. Combine all changes into a clean commit history
4. Submit PR #96 as the final solution

### Option 2: Merge PR #94 First, Then PR #96
1. Rebase PR #94 on main
2. Merge PR #94
3. Rebase PR #96 on the updated main
4. Merge PR #96 

## Steps for Option 1 (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# 2. Create a new clean branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/combined-company-features

# 3. Cherry-pick the unique commits from PR #96
git cherry-pick 518ef41  # Services field fix
git cherry-pick 062d1f0  # Null value fix

# 4. Test everything works
npm test

# 5. Push and create new PR
git push origin fix/combined-company-features
gh pr create --title "Combined: Company write operations with field fixes" \
  --body "Combines PRs #94 and #96 with conflict resolution"
```

## Conflict Resolution Notes

The main conflicts are in:
- `src/objects/companies.ts` - Both PRs modify extensively
- `src/validators/company-validator.ts` - Both add validation
- `src/handlers/tool-configs/companies.ts` - Both add tools
- Many dist files that should be rebuilt anyway
