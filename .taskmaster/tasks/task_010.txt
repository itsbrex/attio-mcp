# Task ID: 10
# Title: Security Penetration Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive security testing including vulnerability assessment and threat modeling
# Details:
Implement automated security testing using OWASP ZAP or similar tools. Test for OAuth-specific vulnerabilities including authorization code interception, CSRF attacks, and redirect URI manipulation. Perform rate limiting bypass testing and input validation fuzzing. Test for XSS, injection attacks, and authentication bypasses. Implement security regression testing and vulnerability scanning in CI pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Automated vulnerability scanning, manual penetration testing, and security code review. Test OAuth 2.0 specific attack vectors and common web vulnerabilities.
