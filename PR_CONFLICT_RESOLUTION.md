# PR #94 and #96 Conflict Resolution Strategy

## Current State Analysis

Both PRs are conflicting with main because:
1. Main branch has evolved significantly (14+ commits ahead)
2. Both PRs modify the same core files
3. PR #96 contains all of PR #94's commits PLUS additional fixes

## Recommended Solution

### Step 1: Close PR #94
Since PR #96 includes everything from PR #94 plus necessary fixes:
```bash
gh pr comment 94 --body "This PR has been superseded by #96 which includes all these changes plus additional fixes. Closing in favor of #96."
gh pr close 94
```

### Step 2: Fix PR #96 (Preferred Approach)
```bash
# 1. Checkout PR #96
git checkout fix/pr94-services-field-dynamic-detection

# 2. Create a backup
git checkout -b fix/pr96-backup

# 3. Go back to the PR branch
git checkout fix/pr94-services-field-dynamic-detection

# 4. Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# 5. Rebase on main (this will show conflicts)
git rebase origin/main

# 6. For each conflict:
# - Keep the new implementations from PR #96
# - Remove deleted dist files
# - Preserve all new features

# 7. Continue rebase after resolving each conflict
git rebase --continue

# 8. Force push the clean history
git push --force origin fix/pr94-services-field-dynamic-detection
```

### Alternative: Create a New Clean PR
If the rebase is too complex:

```bash
# 1. Create fresh branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/combined-company-features-v2

# 2. Apply the essential changes from PR #96
# Company write operations
git cherry-pick cbbf0e7  # Fix: Implement company update handlers
git cherry-pick 0a973d7  # Feature: Add get-company-attributes tool

# Field detection and fixes
git cherry-pick 16f6fb4  # Feature: Add dynamic field type detection
git cherry-pick 9d5ce85  # Fix: Correct services field validation

# Null value fix
git cherry-pick 062d1f0  # Fix: Allow null values in company attribute updates

# 3. Test everything works
npm test

# 4. Create new PR
git push origin fix/combined-company-features-v2
gh pr create --title "Combined: Company write operations with field fixes" \
  --body "This PR combines the work from #94 and #96 with proper conflict resolution.
  
  ## Includes:
  - All company write operations (create, update, delete) from #94
  - Dynamic field type detection
  - Services field fix (string instead of array)
  - Null value handling fix
  - Claude Desktop integration improvements
  
  Closes #94
  Closes #96"
```

## Key Files to Handle Carefully

1. **src/objects/companies.ts**
   - Contains write operations from PR #94
   - Has dynamic field detection from PR #96
   - Must preserve all functionality

2. **src/validators/company-validator.ts**
   - Services field validation
   - Null value handling fix
   - Type validation logic

3. **src/api/attribute-types.ts**
   - New file from PR #96
   - Dynamic field detection logic
   - Must be included

4. **src/api/attio-operations.ts**
   - Modified in both PRs
   - Ensure correct payload structure

## Testing After Resolution

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run all tests
npm test

# Test specific functionality
npm test -- companies.test.ts
npm test -- company-validator

# Manual testing
# 1. Test company creation
# 2. Test company updates with various field types
# 3. Test null value updates
# 4. Test services field with comma-separated values
```

## Decision: Which Approach?

**Recommended**: Try the rebase approach first (Step 2). It preserves the full commit history and is cleaner.

**Fallback**: If rebase is too complex due to extensive conflicts, use the cherry-pick approach to create a fresh PR.

The key is ensuring all functionality from both PRs is preserved while resolving the conflicts with main.
