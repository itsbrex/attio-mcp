# Task ID: 12
# Title: Performance Benchmarking and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish performance baselines and optimize system for production load requirements
# Details:
Implement load testing framework using Artillery or k6. Establish performance baselines for OAuth flow completion (<3s), token validation (<100ms), and API response times (<500ms p95). Optimize database queries, implement connection pooling, and configure caching strategies. Implement horizontal scaling architecture and load balancer configuration. Optimize memory usage and garbage collection tuning.

# Test Strategy:
Load testing up to 1000+ concurrent users. Performance regression testing. Memory leak detection and resource utilization monitoring.
