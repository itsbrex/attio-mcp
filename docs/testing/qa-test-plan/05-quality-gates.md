# Success Criteria & Quality Gates

> **Context:** Decision framework for production readiness and release approval  
> **Prerequisites:** [Test Strategy](./02-strategy.md) - Understanding of priority framework  
> **Usage:** Test managers and project stakeholders for go/no-go decisions

## Overview

This document establishes the quality gates and success criteria that determine system readiness for production deployment. Each priority level has specific thresholds that must be met to proceed to the next phase or approve release.

## Priority-Based Success Metrics

### Quality Gate Framework

| Priority | Success Rate | Quality Gate | Action on Failure |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **P0 - Core** | 100% (5/5) | MANDATORY | STOP - System not ready |
| **P1 - Essential** | ≥80% (3/4) | PRODUCTION GATE | Evaluate readiness |  
| **P2 - Advanced** | ≥50% (3/5) | ENHANCEMENT | Document but don't block |

### Priority Level Details

#### P0 - Core Foundation (MANDATORY)
**Success Threshold:** 100% pass rate required  
**Quality Gate:** MANDATORY - Zero tolerance for failures  

**Rationale:** Core CRUD operations are fundamental to system functionality. Any failure indicates the system is not ready for testing, let alone production use.

**Decision Logic:**
- ✅ **100% Pass:** Proceed to P1 testing
- ❌ **Any Failure:** STOP - Fix issues before proceeding

**Implementation Resources:**
- **Test Cases:** [P0 Core Tests](./04-test-cases/p0-core-tests.md) for detailed procedures
- **Bug Reporting:** [Issue Templates](./06-bug-reporting.md) for failure documentation
- **Escalation:** [Execution Process](./03-execution.md) for workflow guidance

#### P1 - Essential Extensions (PRODUCTION GATE)  
**Success Threshold:** ≥80% pass rate (minimum 3 out of 4 tests)  
**Quality Gate:** PRODUCTION READINESS - Critical for user workflows  

**Rationale:** Essential features like schema discovery and advanced search are important for practical system usage. 80% threshold allows for minor feature limitations while maintaining core functionality.

**Decision Logic:**
- ✅ **≥80% Pass:** System ready for production, proceed to P2
- ⚠️ **<80% Pass:** Evaluate production readiness, may still proceed with documented limitations

**Implementation Resources:**
- **Test Cases:** [P1 Essential Tests](./04-test-cases/p1-essential-tests.md) for detailed procedures
- **Risk Assessment:** [Bug Reporting](./06-bug-reporting.md) for impact evaluation

#### P2 - Advanced Features (ENHANCEMENT)
**Success Threshold:** ≥50% pass rate (minimum 3 out of 5 tests)  
**Quality Gate:** ENHANCEMENT - Nice-to-have capabilities  

**Rationale:** Advanced features enhance user experience but are not critical for basic system operation. Lower threshold acknowledges these are enhancement features.

**Decision Logic:**
- ✅ **≥50% Pass:** Good enhancement coverage
- ⚠️ **<50% Pass:** Document limitations, plan future improvements

**Implementation Resources:**
- **Test Cases:** [P2 Advanced Tests](./04-test-cases/p2-advanced-tests.md) for detailed procedures
- **Documentation:** Track issues in [Bug Reporting](./06-bug-reporting.md) for future releases

## Phase 2 Success Criteria (Usability)

### Usability Validation Thresholds

| Metric | Target | Acceptable | Concerning |
|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Parameter Clarity** | Users execute tools without parameter confusion | ≥90% success rate | <80% success rate |
| **Error Messages** | Clear, actionable error messages for common mistakes | Self-resolution ≥80% | Self-resolution <70% |
| **Documentation** | Tool descriptions sufficient for new users | Task completion ≥85% | Task completion <75% |
| **Edge Cases** | Graceful handling of boundary conditions | No system crashes | Multiple system failures |

### Usability Assessment Criteria

**✅ PASS Criteria:**
- New users can complete basic tasks with documentation alone
- Error messages lead to successful problem resolution  
- Common workflows are intuitive and discoverable
- Edge cases are handled gracefully without data corruption

**Implementation Resources:**
- **Test Cases:** [Usability Tests](./04-test-cases/usability-tests.md) for detailed procedures
- **Fresh Agent Testing:** [Execution Process](./03-execution.md) for usability testing workflow

**❌ FAIL Criteria:**
- New users cannot complete basic tasks without extensive assistance
- Error messages are cryptic or misleading
- Common workflows require trial and error or internal knowledge
- Edge cases cause system crashes or data corruption

## Overall Test Completion Criteria

### Go Decision: System Ready for Production Use

**Required Conditions:**
- [ ] **P0 Results:** 100% pass rate achieved (5/5 tests)
- [ ] **P1 Results:** ≥80% pass rate achieved (≥3/4 tests)
- [ ] **Critical Bugs:** None identified (severity: Critical)
- [ ] **Usability:** No blocking issues found
- [ ] **Documentation:** User-facing docs validated and accurate

**Additional Validation:**
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Security validations completed
- [ ] Data integrity verified
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested

### No-Go Decision: System Requires Additional Development

**Blocking Conditions:**
- ❌ **Any P0 test failure** - Core functionality broken
- ❌ **P1 pass rate <80%** - Essential features insufficient
- ❌ **Critical bugs identified** - System stability at risk
- ❌ **Major usability issues** - Users cannot accomplish basic tasks

**Assessment Process:**
1. Document specific failures and their impact
2. Estimate effort required for resolution
3. Evaluate risk/benefit of proceeding vs. delaying
4. Make stakeholder-informed decision

## Decision Matrix & Escalation

### Automatic Decisions

| Scenario | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| P0 = 100%, P1 ≥ 80%, No Critical Bugs | ✅ **GO** | All quality gates met |
| Any P0 failure | ❌ **NO-GO** | Core functionality broken |
| P0 = 100%, P1 < 50% | ❌ **NO-GO** | Essential features too limited |

### Stakeholder Escalation Required

| Scenario | Escalation Level | Decision Factors |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| P0 = 100%, P1 = 60-79% | **Product Owner** | Business impact, workarounds, timeline |
| Critical bugs with workarounds | **Technical Lead** | Risk assessment, mitigation strategies |
| Major usability issues | **UX/Product Team** | User impact, training alternatives |
